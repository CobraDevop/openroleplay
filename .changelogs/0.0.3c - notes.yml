  - Added in command /jailtime for players
    * This feature allows users to check how much jail time they have left in either RP prison or admin jail

  - Added in a new login screen location
    * This now defers players away from the fact that we roleplay in LS not the back county of LV as was the last interloop camera

  - Added a new control feature with the /ajail command, admins cannot jail themselves
    * This allows control within the commands so that they cannot be abused, other admins will need to punish other admins

  - Removed the old interloop camera login location
    * This was giving the impression that we RP in the county of LV

    * Now vehicles require the newly added functions in option two above to operate them

    * Updated the call function to match if player time is more than one unit and if they are still in jail, only then respawn them

    * This has been fixed with a new door delay timer that freezes players upon entering for 2 secs before they can move
