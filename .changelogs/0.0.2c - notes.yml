Fixed Bugs / Updated Features:

  - New users weren't able to register in the server successfully
    * This was caused by an issue with the character-house-id player variable within the database. This has been corrected

  - Updated the range that the user has to be for the info box to pop up on the dynamic doors
    * This was adjusted from 5.0 radius down to 3.0 radius

  - Once a player purchases a house or gets given one, the textlabel doesn't update owner name accordingly. Shows ([first letter]ULL)
    * Fixed this by placing an array into the command which stores the value of the characters name and removed the playerdata variable
      from the equation
