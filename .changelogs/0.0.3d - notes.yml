Version: 0.0.3d

Added Features:

  - Added in new player health / armor saving variables
    * Now the server will store the players health and armor when a user logs out or quits the server

  - Added in a new player death and injury system
    * This allows the user to roleplay out injuries and also restricts them once they get into hospital. This
      restriction will force them to stay in hospital for one minute before leaving

  - Added in new /acceptdeath command
    * Now the players can choose when they want to accept the death of their character (This allows for roleplay
      to continue on before they decide to give up)

  - Added in new Hospital Interior (temp)
    * Just for location purposes at this current time, we are using a temp map found online

  - Added in new command /setskin for admins
    * This will allow admin level 3 and higher to set the skin of a player

  
Removed Features:

  - Removed the old saveuserinformation function as this was splitting the variations into too many procedures which used up ram space
    and crashed the connections
    * Replaced with new and improved system

Fixed Bugs / Updated Features:

  - Some character features were not being saved upon player exiting game
    * This has been fixed by applying multiple queries at all commands in which targetid is applied to break up the 
      amount of queries running at the point of logout

  - Not all player information was being saved during the mysql query set
    * This has been fixed by incorperating all three queries into one preset field. 

  - Player health and armor wasn't saving correctly as a float variable
    * Updated the procedure to run the check first and then apply the float to the players information

  - Admin jail system wasn't updating user account db upon command execution
    * Updated the SSCANF preceeding value to match the name variable
