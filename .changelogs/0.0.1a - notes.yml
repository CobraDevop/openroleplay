Version: 0.0.1a

Added Features:
  - Server Static Defines
    * This will allow for a smoother development experience by generalising simple controls like
      using SERVER_VERSION instead of typing out '0.0.1.a' all the time etc with other features

  - SQL Static Defines
    * This will allow for a smoother development experience by generalising simple controls like
      using SQL_DB or SQL_USER instead of typing out 'database_name_etc' all the time

  - Basic registration system
    * This allows the user an experience of having options when creating a character, limited to certain
      choices for the begining of the script development

  - OnPlayerRequestClass View
    * This allows the user to not have the "basic" login screen when a user joins a new server. It allows
      for a bit of a scene change

  - Saving users last spawn point
    * This will allow a user to leave the server and log back in where they last were, instead of walking back

Removed Features:
  - Removed all printf functionality around the testing of the login system
    * No longer needed as these feature now work

Fixed Bugs / Updated Features:
  - Registration completion was not updating DB with supplied information
    * Changed '%e' to '%s' which has enable us to save via string instead of int

  - Player coulnd't login to the server
    * Updated the cache_get_field_content values for 'id' and 'password' to match in the DB table

  - Blueberry spawn bug - (In relation to player saving last pos cords)
    * Relocated the cache_get_field_content information down to where the user joins

  - DIALOG_BOXES were very basic in design
    * Reworded and updated the context of those said DIALOG_BOXES to have more detailed information
