Fixed Bugs / Updated Features:

  - Login Spawn System
    * Now if a player logs out with minimal health this will spawn them upon reentry into the local hospital for healing

  - Death System Bug
    * Now when a player dies, the IS_PLAYER_DEAD variable gets updated during the onplayerspawn procedure 
      instead of being forced with spawnplayer function
  
  - On Death Animation Bug
    * When the server restarts, the first person to die won't mimick the crack death animation, only after the first
      player death all other users will mimick this function. After any updates / restarts, I will force a bot to die so
      players do not end up getting bugged when they should be almost dead

  - New players have pop up message about death when registering
    * Added in the IsPlayerDead Variable to reset upon user leaving the server, this has stopped the bug
