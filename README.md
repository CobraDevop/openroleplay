# Open Roleplay - Statement
Welcome to the official release of a custom Open.MP client built roleplay script for the GTA SA multiplayer mod. This roleplay script has been in the works on and off for the last 6 months. Started back in 2022 when Open MP was going through their first initial discussions on what would be offered for the community was this script started as an idea to bring back the sound and feel of those servers from 2008 - 2012. I feel that we lost touch with those communities by implementing things that you wouldn't find in the 90s like smart phones etc using textdraws. I would rather pick up a brick phone in this game.

I had a server open that I had already up hosted for the next five years or until Open MP close their doors, but due to health issues of a family member, I have decided to close this door behind me for good on this script as I do not have the time to continue developing for the community I have founded.

# How to get started
This script is pretty simple to get started. The first step is to look at what includes the script requires and ensure you have those in the qawno, pawno or vs code directories. The database file will not be provided at the initial release of this repository but I might insert it later on when I have time. This script uses all the latest plugins and includes that you can find by navigating the open mp forums or requesting directly.

Ensure that you insert your own database parameters so that you do not error out like others before you. We are currently using the BlueG R41-4 mySQL version.
